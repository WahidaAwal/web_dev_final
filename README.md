Final Project for Practical Web Development Class 

This is a React + Firebase app that allows you to:
- Create a counter (set it to 1)
- Read the current counter value from Firebase
- Update the counter (increase by 1)
- Delete the counter (reset to 0)

In the video, I demonstrate creating the counter, updating it, resetting it, and showing how it updates in Firebase in real-time.
